Mouse cursor controller with MS Kinect

This program control mouse cursor with Kinect(MicroSoft). So running needs Kinect.<br/>
It track user(front of Kinect)'s hand and control mouse cursor with the hand's moving vector.<br/>
It aimed to support to presention with a projected Windows display by projector.

If the user move own hand to up, the cursor will move to up too. Of course, Any direction is too.<br/>
In the side watching Kinect, if the user's hand go to left or right, the cursor will move like reverted horizontally.<br/>
Because we anticipated the displaying screen's location to behind of the user.<br/>


I wanna give you more visible information, but the document outputs for results are disappeared so I feel some hard to describing. ;(
